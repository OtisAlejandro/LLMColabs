        "Hello everyone and thank you for choosing my colab. If you're here for one of the mixed models like Shyg malion, then just select it in the second cell, along with the provider and version. Whichever version you select doesn't matter, because the mixed models use United and it will switch automatically. **This colab contains only tested and certified mixed models. If you are looking for the experimental version with more models, please refer to [this link.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dJIiAVa6vYQkW05C-u0I6ZIRAy2QnH3n?usp=sharing)**\n",

        "1. Although I designed the colab for desktop users, it should not have a problem on mobile as long as you are using desktop mode. If you're on mobile, tap the play button on the first cell so your Colab doesn't get shut down for inactivity.\n",
        "2. Next, select your desired model. If you want more information on a specific model, there is a table with basic information about each of them.\n",
        "3. Click theplay button on the KoboldAI cell next to \"<-- Click this to start the UI\".\n",
        "4. If you get a message saying no accelerator is available/you ran out of runtime, you are gonna need to wait 24 hours for your cooldown to reset, or try again.\n",
        "5. After everything has loaded, you will get a link to the KoboldAI UI that you can also copy into TavernAI's API and use there. If you get a warning for the localtunnel link, just acknowledge it and proceed to the page. If you get a 1033 error with the Cloudflare link, wait 1 minute and refresh the error page.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Further down the page you can find descriptions of the models, and tips to get the most out of your Google Colab experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Make sure to keep this page open while you are using KoboldAI, and check back regularly to see if you got a Captcha. Failure to complete the captcha's in time can result in termination of your session or a lower priority towards the TPUs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Firefox users need to disable the enhanced tracking protection or use a different browser in order to be able to use Google Colab without errors (This is not something we can do anything about, the cookie blocker breaks the Google Drive integration because it uses different domains).\n",
